# CLASSIFICATION OF INTRUSION DETECTION ATTACKS

A novel supervised machine learning system is developed to classify network traffic whether it is malicious or benign. To find the best model considering detection success rate, combination of supervised learning algorithm and feature selection method have been used. Through this study, it is found that Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based machine learning with wrapper feature selection outperform support vector machine (SVM) technique while classifying network traffic. To evaluate the performance, NSL-KDD dataset is used to classify network traffic using SVM and ANN supervised machine learning techniques. Comparative study shows that the proposed model is efficient than other existing models with respect to intrusion detection success rate.

. Existing System:

While network IDS that works based on signature have seen commercial success and widespread adoption by the technology based organization throughout the globe, anomaly based network IDS have not gained success in the same scale. Due to that reason in the field of IDS, currently anomaly based detection is a major focus area of research and development and before going to any wide scale deployment of anomaly based intrusion detection system, key issues remain to be solved. But the literature today is limited when it comes to compare on how intrusion detection performs when using supervised machine learning techniques.

. Proposed System:

The promise and the contribution machine learning did till today are fascinating. There are many real life applications we are using today offered by machine learning. It seems that machine learning will rule the world in coming days. Hence we came out into a hypothesis that the challenge of identifying new attacks or zero day attacks facing by the technology enabled organizations today can be overcome using machine learning techniques. Here we developed a supervised machine learning model that can classify unseen network traffic based on what is learnt from the seen traffic. We used both SVM and ANN learning algorithm to find the best classifier with higher accuracy and success rate.
